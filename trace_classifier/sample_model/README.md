# Sample Model

This folder contains a sample model:

- [`sample_model_optimised_frozen.pb`](sample_model_optimised_frozen.pb) contains the weights of a pretrained model.
- [`sample_model_metadata.json`](sample_model_metadata.json) contains information required to run this model.
- [`config.json`](config.json) contains the parameters used to train this model.
- [`sample_model_training.ipynb`](sample_model_training.ipynb) contains the script used to train this model.
- [`sample_model_inference.ipynb`](sample_model_inference.ipynb) shows how to use the pretrained model for inference.

This is intended to be an example of how to run this library. Performance of this sample model is therefore  irrelevant and not reported here.
